### Data Usage

1. Unzip all the files and set the following path information in a single yaml file `dataset.yaml`:
   - `COD10K`: Directory of **COD10K**, which contains `train` and `test` directories of **COD10K**.
   - `CAMO`: Directory of **CAMO**, which contains `train` and `test` directories of **CAMO**.
   - `NC4K`: Directory of **NC4K**, which contains `img` and `gt` of NC4K.
   - `CHAMELEON`: Directory of **CHAMELEON**, which contains `img` and `gt` of CHAMELEON.
2. Download for the information json for CamoClass dataset (`dataset_info.json`) from 
3. Specify the data roots for training and testing by dataset_info.json.
