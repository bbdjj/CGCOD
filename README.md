> [!note]
> This work has been accepted by ACMMM2025, and we are about to release all the code. ðŸ˜Š
> 
> Details of the proposed Camoclass dataset can be found in the document for [our dataset](https://github.com/bbdjj/CGCOD/releases/tag/dataset/camoclass.zip).
> Furthermore, we plan to provide more fine-grained textual annotations for the dataset. Regarding the training and testing environments, we aim to investigate the modelâ€™s capability to comprehend textual descriptions under complex environmental conditions.

### Data Usage

1. Unzip all the files and set the following path information in a single yaml file `dataset.yaml`:
   - `COD10K`: Directory of **COD10K**, which contains `train` and `test` directories of **COD10K**.
   - `CAMO`: Directory of **CAMO**, which contains `train` and `test` directories of **CAMO**.
   - `NC4K`: Directory of **NC4K**, which contains `img` and `gt` of NC4K.
   - `CHAMELEON`: Directory of **CHAMELEON**, which contains `img` and `gt` of CHAMELEON.
2. Download for the information json for CamoClass dataset (`dataset_info.json`) from 
3. Specify the data roots for training and testing by dataset_info.json.
